                An effective job title wiil typically include a general term, the level of experience and any special
                requirements. The general term will optimize your job title to show up in a general search for jobs of
                the same nature. The level of experience will help you attract the most qualified applicants by
                outlining the amount of responsibility and prior knowledge required. And if your position is
                specialized, consider including the specialization in the job title as well. But avoid using internal
                titles, abbreviations or acronyms to make sure people understand what your job posting is before
                clicking.
