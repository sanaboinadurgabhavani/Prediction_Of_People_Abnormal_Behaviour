Prediction of People Abnormal Behavior Based on Machine Learning
This project aims to predict abnormal behavior in individuals using machine learning techniques. By analyzing patterns in various behavioral data, the model classifies individuals
based on their behavior,helping to detect anomalies that may indicate potential risks. This system can be applied in security, healthcare, and surveillance domains, where early 
identification of abnormal behavior can prevent negative outcomes.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Utilizes preprocessing techniques to clean and transform raw data into usable features for the machine learning model.
Model Selection: Implements several machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, SVM, or Neural Networks to predict abnormal behavior.
Accuracy Evaluation: The model performance is evaluated using standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Real-time Prediction: Capable of making predictions in real-time based on input data, with an easy-to-use interface for deployment.
